GOAL: 
    to make a wordle assistant that takes a user input, takes the index information (gray, yellow, or green spot) and returns a list of likely words from the valid answers list

    list of likely words can be the next best guesses and/or an attempt at the answer

    to make this the best assistant it can be, we will need to somehow incorporate stats of how likely the word will be the answer

    OR find some measure of how the next guessed word will give the most information while still attempting to solve the word
HOW?:
    user inputs their first guess and fills in any gray/yellow/green indexes

    yellow, gray, and green can be represented with values of -1, 0, 1 (or y, w, g) respectively

    once all indeces are filled out, check the list of valid answers and return the list of next best guesses

    returned words MUST have (letter at index i where value == 1 or g i.e. green tile) at index i
    returned words MUST have (letter where value == -1 or y i.e. yellow tile) anywhere in the word
    EXCEPT if there is already a green tile. words at yellow indices cannot appear in the indices marked as green before
    returned words MUST NOT have (letters where value == 0 or w i.e. gray tile) anywhere in the word
        must find a way to keep track of every inputted letter. if inputted letter shows as gray, that letter must be marked for exclusion in future guesses
        or just remove any words with those letters from the list of suggested guesses
